Design System running Tailwind underneath, by michelada.io for everyone.

------

Welcome to the project. We are michelada.io, a Mexican software consultancy based in Colima City, with developers in various parts of the country and even beyond. We are very excited that you are here reading this.

Sips & Bits was born from the need to have a style guide for the internal products that we developed for michelada.io; later, it became a design system that can be included in any project via NPM with ready-to-use web elements.

One of the objectives of this project is to share the michelada.io's way. We want to share how we work, our good practices, processes, and workflow.

Also, this project could be the entry point or the first approach to the world of open source for many early developers, interns, students, programmers who have just finished their studies, or people interested in the world of programming who are making a career change.
