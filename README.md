## Development Workflow  
Welcome to the design system project. Here, we use a different agile practice named Kanban to deliver beatiful CSS üë©‚Äçüíª

Let's talk about our workflow:
1. First thing your need to know, there is no sprints! yay :dance_dog:
2. You decide what to work on. You look at the tickets in the TODO column and assign the one that fits your availability.
   - If you have questions you can ask the Project Manager assigned to this project. 
   - Every ticket should have: description, narrative, definition of done, and acceptance criteria.

### Board statuses

**TODO Column** - every issue that you see here is ready to start working on. Review them, ask questions if necesary and then assign the ticket to you.

**In progress column** - after you asigned your own ticket and you don't have questions, you can move your ticket to the In progress column. The in progress column reflects what you are currently working on. A good practice is to not have more than one ticket in this column.

**Code review column:** - when you move your ticket to this column, make sure you have your PR open with the tag 'ready for review'

Good practices:
- In the description of your MR, add screenshots or videos to show have you have done. 
- Share your PR url in the #design_system channel to let the team know about your work. 
- The techlead in charge of this project is the one that approves your code. 

**Ready for QA column: ** After your code review is approved, you make a demo with one of the designer availables in michelada to review how the component or visual element is displayed. After the designer approves the work.

**Ready to publish column:** After the designer approves your work, you move your ticket here and wait the other work of the milestonre to release it together, create a new version of the library and then publish it in the npm server. 

**Done columna:** Every ticket that was moved to the public npm library is moved here. And your work is completed!
